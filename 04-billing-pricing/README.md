---

## üí∞ AWS Pricing Models

### 1. Pay-As-You-Go
**Concept**: Pay only for what you use, when you use it

**Benefits**:
- No upfront costs
- No long-term commitments
- Scale up or down as needed
- Focus on innovation, not procurement

**Examples**:
- EC2: Per second billing (minimum 60 seconds)
- S3: Per GB stored and requests made
- Lambda: Per request and compute time

### 2. Save When You Reserve
**Concept**: Reserve capacity and save up to 75% compared to On-Demand

**Reserved Instance Types**:
- **Standard RIs**: Up to 75% savings, can modify AZ, instance size
- **Convertible RIs**: Up to 54% savings, can change instance family
- **Scheduled RIs**: For predictable, recurring schedules

**Terms**: 1 year or 3 years
**Payment Options**: All Upfront, Partial Upfront, No Upfront

### 3. Pay Less by Using More
**Concept**: Volume-based discounts

**Examples**:
- **S3**: Cheaper per GB as usage increases
- **Data Transfer**: Tiered pricing
- **CloudFront**: Lower cost per GB at higher volumes

### 4. Benefit from AWS Customer Base
**Concept**: AWS passes savings from economies of scale to customers

**Examples**:
- Regular price reductions
- New lower-cost services
- Infrastructure improvements

### Storage (S3)
**Factors**:
- **Storage Class**: Standard, IA, Glacier, etc.
- **Amount of Data**: Per GB pricing
- **Requests**: GET, PUT, DELETE operations
